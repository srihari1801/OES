Online Examination System
The aim of this project is to develop an online examination
system by applying software engineering principles and best
practices. The proposed system is designed to be scalable, secure and
robust.
The proposed system helps in speeding up the process of
conducting examination. Teachers will be able to conduct
examinations by composing a set of questions that may be multiple
choice questions or single (text) answer question. The system
provides the ability automatically to process results of examination
based on question database. The system will have intelligent
capabilities to mark the text based answers not only when there is an
exact match, but also recognize similar answers by finding the
synonyms of the words used in the answer. The system also provides
manual override feature where in the teacher can manually mark or
update the result for an exam and the capability to resume the
examination from last save point, i.e., a student can stop the
examination in the middle and can start again at any other time.
When the student will start the same examination again, the
exam starts from the same point where it stopped. This system
presents an easy to use interface for Teachers, Students and
Administrators. Once logged in, students will be able to see the
examinations due and can take the examination.
